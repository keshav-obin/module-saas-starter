// release-gates — release orchestration, in two halves.
//
// `authz-coverage` used to be an independent job that no publisher listed in
// `needs`, so a tag run could publish the immutable module package or the
// frontend kit while the authorization gate was red. A red overall workflow
// does not retract an artifact that is already public, and branch protection
// on pull requests does not create a tag-time dependency (audit finding A08).
//
// The fix is one aggregate job, `release-gates`, that every artifact-writing
// job depends on. It runs past a failed dependency (`!cancelled()`) so it can
// inspect its dependencies' outcomes itself: a bare `needs:` cannot distinguish
// a check that passed from one that never ran, and "skipped" must not read as
// consent to publish.
//
//   node scripts/ci/release-gates.mjs decide   # the aggregate job's verdict
//   node scripts/ci/release-gates.mjs check    # the static workflow contract
//   node scripts/ci/release-gates.mjs contexts # what GitHub requires, reconciled
//   node scripts/ci/release-gates.mjs fleet    # which repositories gate a merge
//
// `decide` is the runtime half: given `toJSON(needs)` it fails unless every
// mandatory gate actually succeeded. `check` is the static half: it parses the
// workflow dependency graph and fails unless every artifact-writing job — in
// any workflow, including one added later — is transitively dominated by the
// aggregate, and the aggregate by every mandatory gate. It also fails unless
// every action the workflows call is pinned to a commit digest, since a
// mutable tag lets whoever can move it rewrite any gate, the aggregate
// included, and unless every job that reports a required context can report it
// from a merge-queue entry as well.

// own credentials rather than in CI, and is the thing to run whenever either
// side moves.

// `gh api` exits nonzero on any HTTP error but still writes the response body,
// which carries the status, to stdout. Keeping that status is the whole point:
// a 404 from the branch-protection endpoint means the branch is unprotected,
// while a 403 means the answer was withheld, and reading the second as the
// first reports a repository as ungated when checks do gate it.
// The HTTP answer inside a failed `gh api` call's stdout, or null when there is
// none (no `gh`, no network, a non-JSON body) and the child-process error is
// the only truth available.
//
// `--paginate --slurp` wraps every page in an outer array, and it wraps an
// error body the same way, so on a paginated read the status sits one level
// down. Missing that left the one read that pages — the organization listing,
// also the one most likely to be rate-limited — unclassifiable, throwing the

// have to be read separately because neither endpoint reports the other's
// answer: `rules/branches` returns `[]` for a branch whose merges are gated by
// classic protection, and `branches/*/protection` 404s "Branch not protected"
// for a branch gated by a ruleset. Consulting one alone is how an audit calls a
// gated repository advisory.
//
// A read that failed is the third answer, and it is kept rather than collapsed:
// a branch whose configuration could not be read is neither gated nor
// advisory, and recording it as advisory is the same mistake in the direction
// that hides work.
//
// Which is why `admin` is a parameter. A 404 from the classic-protection
// endpoint does **not** establish that a branch is unprotected: reading it
// requires admin on the repository, and GitHub masks that permission error as
// 404 rather than 403. `cli/cli`'s `trunk` reports `protected: true` on the
// branch object while `branches/trunk/protection` 404s for anyone who does not
// administer it. Trusting that 404 reports a gated repository as advisory —
// the same silent under-report this command replaces — so it counts as an
// answer only when the credential could have seen protection at all.
//
// The ruleset half needs no such care: GitHub documents `rules/branches` as
// returning every active rule that applies regardless of where it is
// configured, and as omitting only rulesets in `evaluate` or `disabled`
// enforcement — which are exactly the ones that gate nothing.
