## Architecture

Two deployment shapes, same business logic:

```
PROD                                   DEV / TEST
─────────────────────────────────────  ─────────────────────────────────────
browser → auth-gateway → api           browser → api
          (validates JWT,                       (in-process Connect+gRPC
           strips Authorization,                 auth interceptors validate
           injects X-User-Id,                    the bearer token directly)
           X-Org-Id headers)
```

Defense-in-depth: the api validates the bearer JWT itself even when the
auth-gateway ext_authz check is in front. A misconfigured ext_authz check / a direct port-hit cannot
bypass auth. Implemented as `connect_auth_interceptor.go` and
`grpc_auth_interceptor.go`.

CORS lives on the api (not the auth-gateway) because Connect-Web preflights
every POST. Permissive in dev (any localhost origin); production puts
the auth-gateway in front so this code path isn't reached.

### Stack

| Layer        | Choice                                               |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Backend      | Go, Connect-RPC + gRPC + grpc-gateway REST (one impl)|
| Frontend     | Next.js 16 (App Router) + Connect-ES + TanStack Query|
| Public site  | Separate Next.js 16 service + repository Markdown     |
| Auth tokens  | Ed25519 JWT, OWASP refresh-token rotation            |
| Identity     | WorkOS / Auth0 / Google / generic OIDC (prod), fixture (dev) |
| Database     | Postgres                                             |
| Cache        | codefly.dev/cache stack for org membership: in-process tier + Redis over the store, 30s TTL, cross-replica invalidation. Revocation, OAuth nonces and rate limits are Redis *state* (noeviction), not cache |
| Secrets      | Vault (signing key + integrations)                   |
| Email        | Resend (prod), log-only fake (dev)                   |
| Billing      | Stripe (checkout, portal, webhook)                   |
| Observability| OpenTelemetry logs/traces/metrics for SigNoz; Sentry errors only |
| Test infra   | Playwright e2e against the real stack via `withDependencies` |

Everything is orchestrated by Codefly: `codefly run service --fixture
dev-admin` resolves the module's service graph and brings up all eight
services—Postgres + Vault + Redis + object storage + telemetry + Accounts +
the private auth gateway + frontend—with seed data in one command. Marketing
remains a separate runtime and may be started, deployed, rolled back, or
disabled without changing the authenticated product.

## Auth flows

### Fixture (dev / test)

`dev-admin.yaml` seeds 4 users: Sarah Chen (super_admin), Alice (admin),
Bob (member), Carol (member). The local Codefly `identity` configuration
explicitly selects `IDENTITY_PROVIDER=fixture`; an explicit
`--fixture dev-admin` then wires the corresponding fixture allowlist and
renders a one-click user picker. Click → POST `/v1/auth/authenticate` with `{provider:
"email", fixture: {token: "dev-bob"}}`; the backend obtains the subject and email
from the selected fixture rather than trusting request fields, then mints JWTs.
A fixture seeds data only and never overrides an external identity profile.

Used by: every Playwright spec, every contributor running `codefly run`.

### WorkOS / Auth0 / Google (production)

Standard OAuth 2.0 authorization-code flow:

1. User clicks "Sign in with WorkOS" → frontend calls `BeginOAuth`; the backend
   validates the exact redirect allowlist and mints a signed CSRF state bound to
   the provider and redirect URI. The frontend stores it in `sessionStorage` and
   redirects to the provider with a PKCE challenge.
2. WorkOS authenticates the user, redirects back to `/auth/callback?code=…&state=…`.
3. Frontend verifies state matches the stored nonce.
4. Frontend POSTs `{provider: "workos", oauth_code: {code, redirect_uri,
   state, code_verifier}}` to `/v1/auth/authenticate`.
5. The WorkOS adapter JSON-POSTs `grant_type=authorization_code`, the code,
   and PKCE verifier to `/user_management/authenticate`, obtaining the signed
   access token and authenticated user object.
6. Backend `Validator.Validate` verifies the access-token signature, issuer,
   client binding, subject, and organization through WorkOS JWKS; the adapter
   then joins the response's verified primary email.
7. `IdentityResolver.Resolve` upserts the user in Postgres, returns an
   internal Identity.
8. `JWTMinter.Mint` issues our own Ed25519 access + refresh pair.

Switching providers means selecting another Codefly `identity` configuration
profile. Product services keep the same generic configuration contract.

### Generic OIDC (any spec-compliant IdP)

`IDENTITY_PROVIDER=oidc` drives the same discovery-based flow as above for any
OpenID Connect provider — Okta, PingFederate, Azure AD / Entra, Keycloak, or a
plain enterprise IdP — with the standard OAuth 2.0 code-grant exchanger rather
than the WorkOS-specific one. The issuer, JWKS, and token endpoint are read
from the provider's `/.well-known/openid-configuration`; nothing about the IdP
is compiled in (`oidc.OktaConfig` in `pkg/auth/oidc/presets.go` is executable
documentation of one concrete instance).

`IDENTITY_PROVIDER` is the identity's `user_identities.provider` namespace. Use
`oidc` for a single generic IdP; give two distinct enterprise IdPs distinct
values (e.g. `IDENTITY_PROVIDER=okta` and `IDENTITY_PROVIDER=ping`) so they do
not share one `(provider, provider_id)` namespace. A non-preset name is a
generic provider only when you also set `IDENTITY_GENERIC_OIDC=true`; without
that opt-in an unrecognized value (such as a typo of `workos`) fails startup
closed rather than silently building a mismatched stack. The frontend reads the
same `identity` group at request time, so the browser, the OAuth request policy,
and the validated token all agree on the provider — a disagreement is rejected at
login.

`user_identities.provider` is a foreign key into the `identity_providers`
reference catalog, so the provider name must be seeded there or login fails.
Migration 90 registers `oidc`, `auth0`, `okta`, and `ping`; a deployment using a
different generic name adds it via its own migration. Startup verifies the
configured provider is registered and fails closed with a precise error if not,
rather than deferring the foreign-key failure to the first login.

Required Codefly `identity` configuration keys:

| Key                     | Required | Purpose                                                            |
|-------------------------|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `IDENTITY_PROVIDER`     | yes      | `oidc`, or a distinct name per IdP (`okta`, `ping`, …)            |
| `IDENTITY_GENERIC_OIDC` | for non-`oidc` names | `true` to enable a generic provider named other than `oidc` |
| `IDENTITY_ISSUER`       | yes      | Issuer URL; discovers JWKS + token endpoint                        |
| `IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID`    | yes      | OAuth client id                                                    |
| `IDENTITY_CLIENT_SECRET`| yes      | OAuth client secret (backend only)                                |
| `IDENTITY_JWKS_URL`     | no       | Pin the key set for IdPs whose discovery document is incomplete or unreachable |
| `IDENTITY_TOKEN_URL`    | no       | Pin the token endpoint for the same reason                        |
| `IDENTITY_AUDIENCE`     | no       | Enforced `aud` (defaults to `IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID`, per standard OIDC) |
| `IDENTITY_EMAIL_CLAIM`  | no       | Email claim name (default `email`)                                 |
| `IDENTITY_ORG_CLAIM`    | no       | Organization-id claim name (default `organization_id`)            |
| `IDENTITY_AUTHORIZE_URL` | no       | Override the authorize endpoint the sign-in button sends the browser to; discovered from `IDENTITY_ISSUER` when unset |
| `IDENTITY_AUTHORIZE_SELECTOR` | no  | WorkOS AuthKit selector (default `authkit`)                   |
| `IDENTITY_DISPLAY_NAME` | no       | Sign-in button label (frontend)                                    |
| `IDENTITY_SCOPE`        | no       | Authorize scope (default `openid profile email`)                   |

Missing issuer, client id, or client secret fails startup with a precise error
rather than at first login.

### Token lifecycle

| Stage         | Mechanism                                                       |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Access token  | Ed25519 JWT, 3-min TTL, with identity, tenant, role, session, and assurance claims |
| Refresh token | Opaque 256-bit random token, SHA-256 hashed in `sessions`, fixed 7-day absolute family lifetime by default |
| Session idle  | Explicit 24-hour idle expiry by default; successful rotation advances idle expiry but never absolute expiry |
| Device policy | Bounded device metadata, stable family id, whole-device revocation, and configurable active-device cap (default 10) |
| Rotation      | One locked transaction consumes the family, resolves current authorization, and inserts one successor |
| Org exchange  | Authenticated target-only exchange; current membership/roles resolved under the active session lock; same device family and refresh credential |
| Reuse defense | Reuse of a token consumed by rotation revokes every active user session; administrative revocation is not replay |
| Logout        | Revokes the refresh family and deny-lists the current access-token JTI in Redis |
| Current state | Refresh requires current authorization; database triggers atomically revoke affected families on status, membership/role, platform-role, and verified-MFA changes |

---

## Authorization model

Two orthogonal axes:

- **Org role** (per-org): owner / admin / member.
- **Platform role** (global): super_admin / billing / support / "" (none).

Backend gates resources via helpers in `pkg/adapters/auth.go`:

| Helper                          | What it enforces                                       |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `requireAuth(ctx)`              | A valid user id is in the wool context                 |
| `requireOrgMember(ctx, orgID)`  | Caller is a member of orgID (Redis-cached, 30s TTL)    |
| `requireOrgAdmin(ctx, orgID)`   | Caller is admin/owner of orgID, or super_admin globally|
| `requireTeamAdmin(ctx, teamID)` | Caller is admin/owner of the team's parent org         |
| `requirePlatformAdmin(ctx)`     | Caller has any non-empty platform role                 |
| `requireSelfOrPlatformAdmin(ctx, target)` | Caller acts on themselves OR is platform-admin |

Frontend mirrors with a `<RoleGate require="admin">` component and
`useCanAccess()` hook. UI gating prevents flash-of-admin-content for
non-admins; **server is still authoritative**.

### Public Connect/gRPC procedures (no auth required)

```
/saas.accounts.v1.AuthService/Authenticate
/saas.accounts.v1.AuthService/BeginOAuth
/saas.accounts.v1.AuthService/BeginWebAuthnMFAChallenge
/saas.accounts.v1.AuthService/CompleteMFAChallenge
/saas.accounts.v1.AuthService/CompleteWebAuthnMFAChallenge
/saas.accounts.v1.AuthService/RefreshToken
/saas.accounts.v1.AuthService/Logout
/saas.accounts.v1.AuthService/GetJWKS
/saas.accounts.v1.BillingService/ListPublicPlans
/saas.accounts.v1.IntrospectionService/GetServiceInfo
/saas.accounts.v1.InvitationService/InspectInvitation
/saas.accounts.v1.UserService/RegisterUser
/saas.accounts.v1.UserService/Version
/saas.accounts.v1.WaitlistService/GetAcquisitionStatus
/saas.accounts.v1.WaitlistService/Join
/saas.accounts.v1.WaitlistService/Verify
```

This list is projected from protobuf `method_policy` exposure and pinned by
catalog tests. All other RPCs, including `AuthService/SwitchOrganization`,
require a valid bearer JWT. Public REST endpoints outside the Connect/gRPC mux
are explicit catalogued extensions rather than implicit bypasses.

## Feature inventory

Legend: ✅ implemented in starter source · 🟡 partial / scoped · ❌ not
implemented. These labels are design inventory, not deployed or externally
attested behavior. The machine-readable production claim model and its default
readiness view are documented in `TRUST_CAPABILITIES.md`.

New capability claims use one of
`implemented_e2e|component_only|experimental|placeholder|planned|not_supported`.
`implemented_e2e` requires a linked route or API, durable state, and journey or
contract test. Existing inventory rows retain the older visual legend until
their next owning change.

### Authentication & sessions

| Feature                             | Status | Notes                                                            |
|-------------------------------------|--------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| OAuth code-grant (WorkOS/Auth0/Google) | ✅  | Generic Codefly `identity` capability with provider-specific exchange adapters |
| Magic link                          | 🟡    | Token gen/verify in `business/magic_links.go`; needs email-send wiring |
| Password login                       | ❌    | Intentional — provider-only; account recovery routed via OAuth    |
| Fixture login (dev)                 | ✅    | Click-to-login in dev mode; not exposed in prod build            |
| MFA (passkeys + TOTP + recovery)    | ✅    | WebAuthn with exact RP/origin policy and encrypted credential state; durable one-use login challenges and recent AAL2 step-up |
| Refresh-token rotation              | ✅    | OWASP family revocation on reuse                                 |
| Session list + revoke               | ✅    | Stable per-device family ids, device context, idle/absolute expiry, whole-family revoke |
| Session lifetime policy             | ✅    | Configurable fixed absolute TTL, idle TTL, and serialized active-device cap |
| Logout                              | ✅    | Revokes the presented device family                              |
| OAuth state / CSRF                  | 🟡    | Validated client-side in `sessionStorage`; no server-side double-check (gap) |
| OAuth PKCE                          | ❌    | Comments mention PKCE but exchanger uses `client_secret` (acceptable for confidential server-side; PKCE adds defense for SPA-driven flows) |
| Account lockout (failed attempts)   | ❌    | No counter on user table                                         |
| Email verification                  | 🟡    | `email_verified` flag stored; no flow that issues + checks       |

| Device fingerprinting               | ❌    | Deliberately not an auth signal; device description is display-only |

### Identity & users

| Feature                  | Status | Notes                                                                          |
|--------------------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| User registration        | ✅    | `RegisterUser` (provider-based; JIT during first login)                        |
| Profile (name, avatar)   | ✅    | Free-form `profile_data` JSON map                                              |
| Multiple linked identities | ✅  | Same user can have WorkOS + Google linked; lookup via `(provider, sub)`        |
| Add identity             | ✅    | `AddIdentity` — gated to self or platform-admin (security fix 2026-04-25)      |
| Find by identity         | ✅    | `FindUserByIdentity` — platform-admin only (security fix 2026-04-25)           |
| List identities          | ✅    | `ListUserIdentities` — gated to self or platform-admin (security fix 2026-04-25) |
| Account deletion request | ❌    | Request/status scaffolding fails closed until a complete deletion, retention, provider-cleanup, and legal-hold workflow is wired |
| Privacy export           | ❌    | Requests and their execution are durable, leased, and receipt-gated ([JOBS.md](./JOBS.md#privacy-workflow-adapter)); fails closed until a complete secure-artifact adapter is wired |
| Verified privacy delete  | ❌    | The durable job and its per-step receipts are in place; no adapter ships, so dataset/provider inventory, retention authority, and legal-hold handling stay adopter work |

### Multi-tenancy (orgs / teams)

| Feature                      | Status | Notes                                                                  |
|------------------------------|--------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Organizations                | ✅    | Create (gated by `ORGANIZATION_CREATION`) / get / list / rename and change slug / delete (archive: credentials and grants revoked, members removed, history kept) |
| Members + roles              | ✅    | owner / admin / member (built-in roles); role changed inline from the members table |
| Teams within orgs            | ✅    | Create / list members; team admins                                     |
| Invitations                  | 🟡    | Hashed seven-day credential, member/admin roles, email/auth handoff, acceptance, resend cooldown, revoke, queued delivery state, and an accept link handed to the administrator (`CreateInvitation`, `IssueInvitationLink`) so an invitation never depends on email; provider delivery projection and scheduled reminders are not included |
| Org branding                 | 🟡    | Logo + name stored; update RPC missing                                 |
| Transfer ownership           | ❌    | No explicit RPC; only role reassignment                                |
| Leave org                    | ✅    | `LeaveOrganization`; the sole member and the last administrator of a shared organization are refused |
| Platform organization view   | ✅    | `/admin/platform/organizations`: every organization, its roster, create for a named owner, edit, delete |
| Org switcher (multi-org user)| ✅    | Generated `SwitchOrganization` exchange; signed session context drives the switcher in the product sidebar and all tenant-scoped queries |
| Org-scoped subdomain         | ❌    | All routing is `app.example.com/admin/...` not `<org>.example.com`     |

### Acquisition, onboarding & activation

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Signup modes | ✅ | Server-enforced `open_signup` (default), `invite_only`, `approval_required`, and `closed` |
| Public waitlist | 🟡 | Enumeration-safe case-folded join, honeypot, public rate limit, optional verification, and source/campaign/referral capture; self-service suppression/deletion is not included |
| Waitlist administration | 🟡 | Platform-admin search/filter, notes/tags, individual approve/reject/invite, authorization, and audit events; batch actions, CSV, and retention automation are not included |
| Auth conversion | ✅ | Existing accounts continue; new accounts are gated by mode and approved/invited email, then attribution is converted |
| Onboarding contract | ✅ | Generated canonical step enum and explicit protobuf-to-UI transform; organization-scoped flow/version state |
| Required setup | ✅ | Organization configuration is server-authoritative and mounted as the required gate |
| Optional checklist | ✅ | Invitation, plan, and API-key steps deep-link to their real product surfaces and remain resumable/skippable |
| Product activation | ✅ | Versioned organization milestone separate from checklist completion |

Onboarding flow `starter_activation` version `1` preserves its own progress
instead of reinterpreting legacy user-global rows. A generated product records
its core value milestone with `RecordProductActivation`; additional milestone
names can use the same organization/flow/version record without changing the
starter checklist.

Invitation credentials are random, expiring, and SHA-256 hashed at rest. The
plaintext appears only in the transactional delivery command and the initial
email URL; it is never returned from `CreateInvitation`. The frontend captures
the query credential into a short-lived HttpOnly, SameSite cookie, immediately
redirects to a redacted URL, sets `no-referrer`, and clears the cookie after
acceptance. Acceptance always re-resolves the authenticated primary email and
performs the membership/status transition in one tenant transaction. Ordinary
invitations allow only `member` or `admin`; ownership transfer remains a
separate, unimplemented high-assurance operation.

### RBAC / permissions

| Feature                | Status | Notes                                                                                |
|------------------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Built-in roles         | ✅    | Org: owner/admin/member · Team: owner/admin/member · Platform: super_admin/billing/support |
| Custom roles           | ✅    | `CreateRole` / `AssignRole` with arbitrary permission strings                        |
| Permission matrix      | ✅    | `CheckPermission(subject, action, resource)`                                         |
| Bootstrap super_admin  | ✅    | First login matching `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_EMAIL` becomes super_admin; self-disarms forever |
| Fine-grained scopes    | 🟡    | API keys carry scope strings (`x-scopes` header); not enforced at handler level (gap) |
| ABAC / row-level rules | ❌    | Not modeled                                                                          |

| Worker database isolation | ✅ | Function-only tenant enqueue plus grant-limited `app_job_worker`; no request payload reads or worker product-table access |
| Generic execution runtime | ✅ | Generated worker commands plus atomic claim, heartbeat, retry, recovery, fencing, ordering, and dead-letter operations |
| Worker lifecycle and telemetry | ✅ | Generic polling runtime, redacted typed failures, queue-only metrics, per-poll/job traces, and deadline-based graceful shutdown |
| Job operations | ✅ | Super-admin payload-free queue/job/history UI plus recent-MFA, idempotent, audited dead-letter replay copied inside PostgreSQL |
| Workload convergence | 🟡 | Stripe, outbound webhooks, and transactional email use generated generic job adapters; exports and approvals follow |

The persistence, producer, lifecycle, operations, Stripe, outbound-webhook, and
email adapter contracts are ready. Remaining workers migrate independently;
see `JOBS.md` for the exact boundary and sequencing.

### Notifications

| Feature                | Status | Notes                                                               |

### Admin panel

| Feature                | Status | Notes                                                              |
|------------------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| User search & CRUD     | ✅    | Platform-admin can suspend / unsuspend / delete                    |

### Compliance & legal

| Feature                  | Status | Notes                                                            |
|--------------------------|--------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Privacy export artifact  | ❌    | Expiry is enforced on read and swept from storage, but the UI stays disabled until secure storage, subject binding, and completeness are verified |
| Verified data deletion   | ❌    | UI disabled until dataset rules, blockers, provider cleanup, retained records, and receipts are complete |
| Audit purge configuration| 🟡    | Starter database policy only; deployment retention is adopter-owned and must be evidenced |
| Terms acceptance         | ✅    | Versioned authenticated evidence, separate from optional tracking choices |
| Purpose consent          | ✅    | Necessary, analytics, and marketing choices with policy version, context, timestamp, and withdrawal |
| Legal routes             | ✅    | `/legal/terms` and `/legal/privacy`; production operator content must be configured and legally reviewed |
| Optional SDK gating      | ✅    | Analytics and marketing default off; `consentchange` is emitted immediately on grant or withdrawal |
| Assurance evidence       | ❌    | No certification or attestation ships with the starter           |

The unconfigured legal routes show a technical placeholder, not legal advice.
`NEXT_PUBLIC_LEGAL_ENTITY_NAME`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_LEGAL_CONTACT_EMAIL`,
`NEXT_PUBLIC_LEGAL_TERMS_CONTENT`, and `NEXT_PUBLIC_LEGAL_PRIVACY_CONTENT` must
all be configured before Terms can be accepted, and adopters must legally review
the supplied content for their product and jurisdictions. Anonymous browser
preferences are used only to fail optional SDKs closed; they are not treated as
authenticated legal evidence.

The dev placeholders are opt-in and safe-by-default: they apply only when
`NEXT_PUBLIC_LEGAL_DEV_PLACEHOLDER` is truthy at build time, which `next.config.mjs`
derives from the Codefly fixture boundary — so the local fixture stack gets a
usable Terms gate with zero config, while a real deploy (which never builds under
a fixture) defaults to the enforced gate rather than silently shipping placeholder
terms. Because `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` values are inlined at build time, a production build
that omits the four operator vars ships an un-acceptable gate; the `build` script
runs `scripts/check-public-legal-env.mjs` to warn when that happens.

### Frontend (Next.js)

The FE is intentionally MVC-style: most pages are thin shells around
library components in `src/features/<area>/ui/`, so consumers can swap
implementations without rewriting the route handlers.

| Surface                | Pages                                                                          |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Auth & acquisition     | `/auth/login`, `/auth/callback`, `/auth/magic-link`, `/invitations/accept`, `/waitlist`, `/waitlist/verify` |
| Legal                  | `/legal/terms`, `/legal/privacy`                                                 |
| Dashboard (every user) | `/`, `/notifications`, `/onboarding`, `/settings/{mfa,notifications,data,privacy}` |
| Subscription           | `/admin/billing`, `/admin/billing/success`                                     |
| Org admin (`/admin/*`) | `users`, `organizations`, `teams`, `roles`, `invitations`, `api-keys`, `audit-log`, `webhooks`, `entitlements`, `billing` |
| Platform admin         | `/admin/platform/{admins,feature-flags,waitlist}`, `/admin/sessions`           |
| Docs                   | `/docs/sdks`, `/docs/compliance`                                               |

### Marketing (Next.js, separate deployable)

The public service owns apex/`www` content and never imports product sessions,
dashboard packages, server secrets, tenant data, or database stores. It ships
home, product, use-case, pricing, company, contact, blog, docs, changelog,
security, legal, consent, accessibility, maintenance, 404, and error surfaces.
Content comes from a strict repository Markdown provider; drafts and scheduled
items are excluded from routes, feeds, search, and indexing.

Public pricing is fetched from `GET /v1/public/plans`, a sanitized projection
of the accounts plan catalog. Marketing does not define prices, currencies,
intervals, trials, limits, or checkout eligibility. A catalog outage produces
an explicit degraded CTA while cached public content and readiness remain
available.

Brand, domains, locales, contacts, acquisition mode, attribution fields, and
public plan visibility come from validated `public/site.config.json`. The
checked-in values are unmistakable development fixtures, and strict production
readiness rejects placeholder claims, domains, contacts, or disabled indexing.
See `services/marketing/README.md` for deployment, caching, disablement, and
extraction contracts.

|------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Feature flags (per-org)                        | ✅          | Same — usually external (LaunchDarkly) |
| Entitlements (plan → feature gates)            | ✅          | 🟡 (many use Stripe metadata — ours is first-class) |
| In-app notifications                           | ✅          | Same              |
| SSE / real-time                                | ✅          | 🟡 (often WebSocket; SSE is simpler & sufficient) |

| Custom SSO (SAML / OIDC dynamic clients)       | ✅          | ✅ (2026-04-25: SSOAdminService + /admin/sso self-serve WorkOS Admin Portal flow with stub-mode for dev) |
| Webhooks UI (test event, replay, signing key)  | ✅          | ✅ (Stripe-style; v2 added 2026-04-25: replay, rotate-secret, deliveries inspector) |
| API rate limiting per org/key                  | ✅          | ✅ (2026-04-25: Redis-backed fixed-window limiter on Connect + gRPC; X-RateLimit-* headers exposed via CORS + low-budget banner on FE) |
| Usage metering + billing UI                    | ✅          | ✅ (catalogued tenant-RLS event ledger, atomic quota consumption, UTC history, headroom, forecast, and billing/admin UI) |

| Activity feed (in-app)                         | 🟡          | ✅ (audit log is queryable but not user-facing UI yet) |

### "Best in the world" additions (beyond table stakes)

These are what separate a top-tier from a typical starter. Roughly
prioritized by leverage:

1. **Cmd-K command palette** — search users, orgs, audit log, navigate
   anywhere. Single biggest UX upgrade for admin-heavy products.
2. **Webhooks dashboard with replay** — Stripe-style "Last Delivery"
   with response body / status code / replay button. Customer-trust
   accelerator.
3. **API rate limiting + key scopes enforced** — prerequisite for any
   product that exposes its API.
4. **MFA enforcement policy** — `requireMFA(ctx)` decorator on billing,
   role grants, GDPR delete. We have the storage; we need the gate.
5. **Org-scoped subdomains** — biggest UX/multi-tenancy upgrade for
   B2B SaaS. Cookie scope, branding, white-label all flow from this.
6. **Sample data extension** — optionally let products add a demo-data action
   after required organization setup.
7. **Independent incident communication** — keep `/status` as a live probe,
   then connect and exercise a status channel outside the product failure domain.
8. **Self-serve SSO admin** — paying enterprise plans should be able to
   wire SAML themselves. WorkOS Connections handle this if we expose it.
9. **Audit log streaming to customer S3 / Datadog** — compliance teams
   ask for this on day one of vendor review.
10. **Billing usage UI** — chart of usage vs plan limit, "you'll hit
    your limit on day X" projections. Big retention/expansion lever.

## Known security gaps

Severity: 🔴 critical · 🟠 important · 🟡 hardening

### Open

_All previously-open gaps closed 2026-04-25._

### Resolved 2026-04-26

- ✅ **GetOrgEntitlements had no authz** — any authenticated user could read any org's plan + usage. Now gated by `requireOrgMember` (platform admins implicitly satisfy via membership).
- ✅ **OverrideEntitlement had no authz** — implicit JWT-only. Now requires `platformAdmin`.
- ✅ **API key scopes enforced on more endpoints** — webhooks (Create/Delete/List/Test/GetDelivery/ReplayDelivery/RotateSecret) and api-keys (Create/List/Revoke). 5 new unit tests pin the wildcard semantics + the JWT pass-through.
- ✅ **Self-serve SSO admin (WorkOS Connections)** — proto SSOAdminService + business / handler / WorkOS HTTP client + migration 21 + /admin/sso FE. Stub-mode when the selected Codefly identity configuration has no `IDENTITY_MANAGEMENT_API_KEY`, so dev exercises the full flow.
- ✅ **Audit-export FE admin form** — was backend-only; /admin/audit-export now lets org admins configure their bucket through the UI. Pre-flight connection probe at Save time so bad creds fail fast.
- ✅ **s3 plugin now actually runs MinIO** — was a redis-template scaffold (port 6379, redis ping readiness); now real (port 9000, /minio/health/live, structured conn keys, agent v0.0.2).
- ✅ **User settings API** — JSONB-backed (`users.settings`) + UserSettingsService + /settings hub (theme / locale / timezone / date-time format / email opt-ins).
- ✅ **Theme toggle** — next-themes wired with system / light / dark, persists per user via the settings API, syncs across devices.
- ✅ **Stripe billing portal in /admin/billing** — Connect-RPC `BillingService.OpenPortal` works without the auth-gateway.
- ✅ **Stripe invoices list** — last 12 invoices on /admin/billing with hosted-detail link + PDF download.
- ✅ **Rate-limit visibility** — X-RateLimit-* exposed via CORS; FE captures every response, banner appears at <10% remaining.

### Resolved 2026-04-25

- ✅ **User identity endpoints unauthenticated** — `AddIdentity`, `FindUserByIdentity`, `ListUserIdentities` would let any authenticated caller enumerate provider identities or attach attacker-controlled identities to any user. Now gated by `requireSelfOrPlatformAdmin` / `requirePlatformAdmin`.
- ✅ **gRPC server had no in-process auth interceptor** — handlers assumed the auth-gateway ext_authz check was in front; direct port hits bypassed auth. Added `grpcAuthInterceptor` mirroring the Connect interceptor (defense in depth: api validates the bearer regardless of upstream).
- ✅ **Connect server had no CORS** — browser preflight returned 405; every Connect-Web request from the FE failed in production-style architectures. Added `rs/cors` middleware.
- ✅ **MFA is enforced and refresh-safe** — enrolled users receive no normal session until a durable one-use challenge succeeds. JWT/session evidence carries `amr`, `auth_time`, `acr`, and `mfa_at`; refresh preserves rather than renews that evidence. Refresh re-resolves verified enrollment: newly enrolled MFA terminates AAL1 refresh families and requires login, while removed MFA strips factor methods and downgrades the successor to AAL1. General sensitive operations apply the configured recent-AAL2 policy to enrolled users; money-moving billing checkout/portal is stricter and always requires fresh AAL2, so lack of enrollment is not a bypass. Passkeys require WebAuthn user verification with exact Codefly-configured RP/origin policy; complete credentials and ceremony state use Vault Transit envelopes. TOTP seeds are encrypted and recovery codes are one-use bcrypt hashes.
- ✅ **API key scopes forwarded but not enforced** — the auth-gateway ext_authz check set `X-Scopes`; handlers ignored. New `requireScope(ctx, "resource:action")` gate with wildcard support (`*`, `users:*`, `*:read`). Applied to `ListUsers`, `UpdateUser`, `DeleteUser` as a starter set; extend to other resources per business needs (JWT-authenticated callers bypass — RBAC handles them).
- ✅ **Access tokens not individually revocable** — Logout only killed the refresh chain; old access tokens stayed valid up to 15 min. New `auth.TokenRevoker` interface + `cache.NewTokenRevoker` Redis impl. `Logout(refresh, accessToken)` now calls `JWTMinter.RevokeAccess` which adds the jti to the revocation list with TTL = remaining `exp`. `VerifyAccess` consults the list. Falls back to `NoopTokenRevoker` (no Redis) → original behavior.
- ✅ **Impersonation had no time limit** — admin "view-as" sessions inherited the normal 15-min TTL. New `Config.ImpersonationTokenTTL` (default 5 min) auto-applied when minting tokens with `acting` claim set.
- ✅ **Cache invalidation on member-remove** — confirmed correct on a closer read. `CacheInvalidator.InvalidateMembership` calls `cache.Delete` against shared Redis, so all api instances see the change immediately. The 30s TTL is safety net, not staleness window.
- ✅ **OAuth `state` not validated server-side** — added `auth.OAuthStateSigner` (HMAC-SHA256, key derived from the JWT private key with a domain label, 10-min TTL). `BeginOAuth(provider, redirect_uri) → state` mints a server-signed token bound to provider + redirect URI. `Authenticate` requires and re-verifies it; mismatch returns the canonical `ErrInvalidOAuthState` without an oracle. The frontend fails closed if state cannot be minted. At ingress, frontend derives the exact callback origin from the real request and authenticates it to auth-gateway with Codefly's internal service credential; auth-gateway carries it across the gateway-token boundary. `IDENTITY_ALLOWED_REDIRECT_URIS` is only an optional fallback for intentional direct access.
- ✅ **PKCE for OAuth code flow** — FE now generates a 64-byte `code_verifier` per sign-in, computes SHA-256 `code_challenge`, and includes both in the authorize URL. `code_verifier` rides through `Authenticate` to `Exchanger.Exchange`, which forwards it as the standard `code_verifier` form parameter to the provider's token endpoint. Belt-and-suspenders alongside the existing `client_secret` flow — recommended even for confidential clients per OAuth 2.1.
- ✅ **Connect error code translation** — handlers return `status.Error(codes.X, ...)` (gRPC) but Connect-Go didn't recognize the wrapper, defaulting every error to `CodeUnknown` → HTTP 500. Added `translateGRPCError` in the Connect `unary` adapter mapping all 16 gRPC codes to their Connect equivalents. Without this, the auth-boundary tests showed Bob's `PermissionDenied` as 500 instead of 403, masking the real behaviour.
- ✅ **Rate limiting per org / API key** — `cache.RateLimiter` (Redis-backed fixed-window) + Connect/gRPC interceptors. Key derivation: API-key id > org id > user id. Default 1000 req/min, configurable. Returns `ResourceExhausted` (gRPC 8 / HTTP 429) with `Retry-After` and `X-RateLimit-*` headers; nil-receiver / nil-cache / zero-limit all degrade to allow-all so an unconfigured Redis can't mass-reject. 5 unit tests cover budget exhaustion, per-key isolation, and graceful degradation.
- ✅ **Cmd-K command palette** — global cmd/ctrl+K dialog at the dashboard root. Its generated navigation projection is shared with the sidebar/plugin registry and role-gated (admin / super_admin / personal); async user search uses Connect-ES (200ms debounce, super_admin only — server-gated, not just UI). E2E specs cover hotkey, role visibility, and navigation. Built on the existing cmdk + shadcn primitives (zero new deps).

## Roadmap

There is no roadmap in this file. What the host still owes its functional
contract — the `HOST-*` stories on its handbook page — is tracked story by story
in the repository's one plan, `docs/PLAN.md` at the repository root.

When `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` is configured, the accounts service and the
auth-gateway export unsampled request and Go runtime metrics through the in-graph
OpenTelemetry collector. The auth-gateway covers both its HTTP gateway and gRPC ext_authz
authorization service. Prometheus can alternatively scrape `/metrics` on each
service's private REST endpoint; neither route is a module or public interface
endpoint.

Frontend browser configuration. The server reads each value from its Codefly group per
request (`identity`, `legal`, `product-features`, `product-analytics`, `error-tracking`,
`abuse-protection`) and hands it to the browser — a deployed image is built once and
configured per environment, so nothing below is inlined at build time except where noted.
The keys keep their `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` names only so an existing group keeps working. The CSP
admits the analytics origin and Turnstile from the same per-request read. A restricted
render refuses a plain key named like a credential, so `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` may be
provisioned in the `error-tracking` group's secret half; it is the only secret-namespace
key the frontend hands to a browser, and it is public by design:

| Var                          | Used for                                                    |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_SUBSCRIPTIONS` / `_SSO` / `_ENTITLEMENTS` | `product-features`: show the optional screens ([PRODUCT_FEATURES.md](./PRODUCT_FEATURES.md)) |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_COLLECTION_CONTENT_RESOURCE` | `product-features`: permission resource collection content is governed by; empty means undeclared |

| `NEXT_PUBLIC_LEGAL_CONTACT_EMAIL` | Legal/privacy contact; required before Terms acceptance |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_LEGAL_TERMS_CONTENT` | Operator-supplied Terms; required before Terms acceptance |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_LEGAL_PRIVACY_CONTENT` | Operator-supplied Privacy Policy; required before Terms acceptance |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_LEGAL_DEV_PLACEHOLDER` | Build-time: opt-in dev legal placeholders; defaults from the fixture boundary via `next.config.mjs`, off for real deploys |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_PRODUCT_ANALYTICS_MODE` | Explicit `disabled` or `posthog` browser analytics mode |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY`      | Public PostHog capture key in PostHog mode                    |

| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_RELEASE` | Build-time: correlates frontend errors with a release       |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_SEND_PII` | `1` sends IPs / cookies / search params to Sentry           |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_ABUSE_PROTECTION_MODE` | Explicit `disabled` or `turnstile` widget mode          |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY` | Public Turnstile widget key                              |

Accounts REST and Connect browser calls are relative and same-origin. The server
forwards them to `auth-gateway/rest` — the single product API path — and to
nothing else; backend origins are never published to browser code. `src/proxy.ts`
forwards the two product API namespaces onto that endpoint and server route
handlers dial it directly, both resolving it through the Codefly SDK on the
request, so a frontend composed with its `auth-gateway` dependency needs no
configuration. Nothing is baked into the build: an image carries no product API
address at all, so a server forwards to the gateway its own composition
injected — never one a build host happened to see. A frontend started outside the
module graph (the browser suite's own server) names the same gateway explicitly
with `PRODUCT_GATEWAY_INTERNAL`; a server that resolves no gateway refuses to
start, and fails any product API request closed rather than answering it from
the Next app.

`API_REST_INTERNAL` and `API_CONNECT_INTERNAL` are retired. They pointed the
server straight at Accounts, which bypassed the gateway's route allow-list, rate
limiter, and identity-header discipline. Setting either one now fails startup
with a migration error: remove it, and either compose the frontend with its
`auth-gateway` dependency or set `PRODUCT_GATEWAY_INTERNAL` to the gateway's REST
address.

## How to evaluate this starter against your needs

If you're picking a starter, ask:

1. Does it support our identity provider? **WorkOS / Auth0 / Google ✅; SAML via WorkOS ✅; LDAP ❌**
2. Multi-tenant from day one? **Yes — orgs/teams/roles built in.**
3. Stripe integration that won't bite us in prod? **Webhook signature + idempotency + portal + checkout ✅.** Dunning flows are basic.
4. Audit and assurance ready for external review? **The starter includes audit and impersonation controls, but privacy completion, production retention, legal review, and external assurance remain adopter responsibilities.**
5. Real tests that actually exercise auth/billing/audit? **Yes — Playwright e2e against the running stack.**
6. Easy to run locally? **One command (`codefly run service --fixture dev-admin`); no docker-compose surgery.**
7. What production work remains? Use the evidence-bound readiness view at `/docs/compliance`; it keeps unverified privacy, recovery, incident, legal, and assurance capabilities explicit.
