// A deactivation is not a membership change and cannot be expressed as one: it
// leaves every organization_members row standing and removes the identity from
// all of them at once, so the invariant has to be evaluated per organization
// and all of those organizations have to be pinned at the same time. Callers
// hold the locks for the rest of the transaction that writes the status, which
// is what serializes a deactivation against a concurrent removal or demotion in
// any of the same organizations.
//
// The loop is the load-bearing part, and one pass is not enough. A promotion
// can only raise an administrator count, so AddOrgMember settles it from its
// argument and takes no administration lock — which means the identity can be
// made an administrator of an organization this loop has already read past.
// Deciding on an organization whose lock is not held admits exactly the
// interleaving the lock exists to stop: the promotion lands, a demotion in that
// same organization counts this identity (still active, because this
// transaction has not committed) and commits, and then the deactivation commits
// on top and leaves the organization with nobody. So the loop re-reads until
// the roster comes back unchanged with every organization in it already locked,
// and only then decides.
//
// Organizations are locked in ascending id, and the order is established here
// rather than trusted from the query, because it is this loop that depends on
// it: it is what keeps two concurrent deactivations over shared organizations
// queueing instead of waiting on each other. A pass that discovers a new
// organization sorting below one already held does acquire out of that order —
// unavoidable, since a transaction-scoped advisory lock cannot be released to
// retake it — so two deactivations that discover each other's organizations
// mid-loop can deadlock. PostgreSQL detects that and aborts one with a loud
// serialization error; it is a far better failure than the silent stranding it
// replaces, and it needs a promotion to land inside both loops to happen at all.
