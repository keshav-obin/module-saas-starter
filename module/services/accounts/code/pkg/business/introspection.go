// ServiceVersion is the semver of THIS service's API surface (the
// api service of the saas-starter module). Bump on proto-breaking
// changes; clients can branch on it via GetServiceInfo.
//
// Module-level version is a separate concern owned by the module
// declaration (module.codefly.yaml), not by this service.
const ServiceVersion = "0.4.0"

// GetServiceInfo returns the machine-readable catalog of THIS
// service: its RPC surface, RBAC vocabulary, RLS-protected tables,
// and accepted API-key scopes.
//
// Each codefly service owns its own proto and exposes its own
// IntrospectionService. A "module-level" view of saas-starter is an
// AGGREGATION concern: a CLI/gateway/aggregating host walks every service in
// the module and merges each service's GetServiceInfo response.
// That aggregator is intentionally out of scope here.
//
// Drift resistance: RPCs, HTTP routes, and enforcement policy are derived from
// the protobuf descriptor graph. Adding a method without a complete
// saas.policy.v1.method_policy option leaves it unclassified, so interceptors
// deny it and the completeness test fails. Only editorial descriptions remain
// in rpcDescriptions until P1-DOC-001 makes source comments compiler-readable.
//
// The redaction pass at the end strips platform_admin / mfa-tier
// RPCs for unauthenticated callers, and the RLS catalog with them
// (the catalog is exposed publicly at GET /v1/.well-known/service-info;
// no need to advertise the privileged attack surface to anonymous
// probes). The relation inventory names every user-scoped relation and
// the column that scopes it, and its notes describe the mechanisms
// behind each boundary — evidence for an authenticated auditor, a
// schema map for an anonymous one. Authenticate for it.
